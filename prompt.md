for this code, what prompt would you give to agent so that iteratively builds a more and more capable agent?, maybe saving each agent as cua_n.py, where n could be a number or a description of the abilities of the agent.

I would like to end up with an agent with all permmissions to the OS, maybe just eval whatever LLMs send back. Code is running in a docker container with a desktop environment, is that safe enough?

I would like to give these tasks to the nth agent, and for it to ensure tasks are complete without me having to review:
