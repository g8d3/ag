It addresses the conservatism of SARSA by dynamically adjusting the trust region size based on the observed variance in the Q-value estimates. A larger trust region is allowed when variance is low, enabling faster learning, while a smaller trust region is enforced when variance is high, preventing drastic policy changes and improving stability. It also incorporates a clipping function, similar to PPO, acting on the SARSA update target to further constrain policy updates within the adaptive trust region. This allows the algorithm to be more aggressive in exploration while maintaining stability and preventing catastrophic policy collapse.\",\n  \"pseudo_code\": \"```\\nAlgorithm ATRSarsa:\\n\\nInput:\\n  - Environment env\\n  - Learning rate \u03b1 (alpha)\\n  - Discount factor \u03b3 (gamma)\\n  - Initial trust region radius \u03b4 (delta)\\n  - Clipping parameter \u03b5 (epsilon)\\n  - Variance threshold \u03b8 (theta) for trust region adjustment\\n\\nInitialize:\\n  - Q-table Q(s, a) arbitrarily\\n  - Policy \u03c0(s) \u2190 argmax_a Q(s, a) (e.g., \u03b5-greedy)\\n  - Trust region size Delta(s,a) = \u03b4 for all states and actions\\n\\nLoop for each episode:\\n  Initialize state s\\n  Choose action a from s using policy \u03c0 (e.g., \u03b5-greedy)\\n\\n  Loop for each step in the episode:\\n    Take action a, observe reward r and next state s'\\n    Choose next action a' from s' using policy \u03c0 (e.g., \u03b5-greedy)\\n\\n    # Calculate SARSA target\\n    target = r + \u03b3 * Q(s', a')\\n\\n    # Calculate advantage estimate (using target and current Q)\\n    advantage = target - Q(s, a)\\n\\n    # Clip the advantage to constrain policy updates\\n    ratio = advantage / Delta(s,a) # Normalized advantage\\n    clipped_advantage = clip(ratio, -\u03b5, \u03b5) * Delta(s,a) # Clip to scaled epsilon\\n\\n    # Update Q-value using clipped advantage\\n    Q(s, a) = Q(s, a) + \u03b1 * (clipped_advantage) # Effectively Q(s, a) + \u03b1 * (clip(r + \u03b3 * Q(s', a') - Q(s, a), -Delta(s,a)*epsilon, Delta(s,a)*epsilon))\\n\\n    # Update policy based on updated Q-values\\n    \u03c0(s) = argmax_a Q(s, a) (e.g., update \u03b5-greedy probabilities)\\n\\n    # Adaptive Trust Region Update:\\n    # Estimate variance in Q-value updates for (s,a) - e.g., using a moving average\\n    variance = calculate_q_value_variance(Q, s, a) # Example: exponential moving average of squared error\\n\\n    # Adjust trust region size Delta(s,a) based on variance:\\n    if variance > \u03b8:\\n      Delta(s,a) = max(Delta(s,a) * 0.9, \u03b4*0.1)  # Decrease trust region size (minimum size to prevent collapse)\\n    else:\\n      Delta(s,a) = min(Delta(s,a) * 1.1, \u03b4*10)  # Increase trust region size (maximum size to prevent over-optimism)\\n\\n    s = s'\\n    a = a'\\n\\n    If s is terminal:\\n      break\\n```\"\n}\n```",
